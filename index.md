One of the fastest ways to start truly engaging with your community is to give them a peek behind the curtain. Let them see who you are BEYOND just business.
The fact is that we are living through the humanization of business and people are extremely interested in the person BEHIND the business itself.
More than ever… we crave RELATIONSHIPS!
People don't want cheesy marketing messages . . . they want YOU.
Your story… Your life… Your own unique personality infused into everything you do.
Your readers will be attracted to your weird quirks because they make you human.
When your flawed your real.
That's one of the biggest pieces of advice I could give you this year.
Give people a peek behind the curtain.
